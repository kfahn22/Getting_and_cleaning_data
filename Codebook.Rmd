3) a code book that describes
##the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed
to clean up the
##data called CodeBook.md

The final data set contains 180 observations of 68 variables.  

1. subject is an id variable ranging from 1-30 that identifies the volunteer
2. activity is an id variable that lists the activity of the volunteer. 
Columns 3:68 contain the average value of the processed data for each subject and activity

The numeric data has been recoded as required by the assignment to reflect more descriptive labels

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
